# PART 3: Assigning Variables

x = 9  # Using a single '=' to declare a variable
y: int  # Use a ':' to declare what kind of variable (Not necessary, only used for max efficiency)
z: float = 1.5  # You can declare the variable and the variable type at the same time

first_name = 'Alex'  # String Values require quotations when being declared
last_name = "Steele"  # Single and double quotations both work
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name  # Use the '+' to add strings together
print(full_name)
